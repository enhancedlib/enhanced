Supported C Standard: C89, C98, C11
Supported C++ Standard: C++98, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20

Please use the C standard "C11" and the C++ standard "C++20" to build this software.

This library provide rich data types and a large number of classes, functions/methods.
I hope to use this library to make the C/C++ language software development more convenient and efficient.
