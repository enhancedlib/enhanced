## âš  **Warning: Not Production Ready!**

This project is still in the early stage, many features are immature or unimplemented.

Do not use in production environment. ***Otherwise, do so at your own risk!***

## 1.Introducing

This software is a library for the C/C++ language.
It contains many useful modules with a powerful variety of classes and functions (methods):

Note: many functions have not been developed yet, and will be gradually added in the future.

- 1. Basic data types (e.g. String, Integer)
- 2. More powerful exception handling (including C language support)
- 3. Containers (collection, set, map, etc.)
- 4. Template (generic) classes and functions (C++ only)
- 5. Threading.
- 6. Cross-platform underlying APIs
- 7. Data processing.
- 8. ...

## 2.Install/Uninstall

There is no installer yet, you can download the source code, build the project yourself.

- The installer and uninstaller will be provided in the future.

## 6.Technology

### About Generics (Templates) in This Project

In this project, a class whose class name is follows "Impl" is a generic implementation class of a generic class.
Most implementations of generic classes are in the implementation classes (except for a few special generic classes).

They separate the implementation of the generic classes from the generic by type erasure (pseudo-generic).

You should not extend (inherit) the implementation class from another class, and you should not instantiate the implementation classes directly.
The correct approach is to instantiate the generic classes, because the implementation classes have no public methods.
