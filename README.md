## 1.Introducing

This software is a library for the C/C++ language.
It contains many useful modules with a powerful variety of classes and functions (methods):

Note: many functions have not been developed yet, and will be gradually added in the future.

1. Basic data types (e.g. String, Integer)
2. More powerful exception handling (including C language support)
3. Containers (collection, set, map, etc.)
4. Template (generic) classes and functions (C++ only)
5. Threading.
6. Cross-platform underlying APIs
7. Data processing.
8. ...

## 2.Install/Uninstall

There is no installer yet, you can download the source type, build the project yourself.

- The installer and uninstaller will be provided in the future.
