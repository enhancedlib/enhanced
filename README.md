## Introducing

This software is a library for the C++ language.
It contains many useful modules with a powerful variety of classes and functions:

- Note: many of the features have not been developed yet, and will be gradually added in the future.

1. Useful classes and functions
2. More powerful exception handling
3. Collections/containers (list, set, etc.)
4. Threading
5. Data processing
6. Networking
7. More...

To use this library, you should use at least the C++20 standard.
