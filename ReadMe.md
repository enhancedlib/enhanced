## âš  Warning: Not Production Ready!
This project is still in the early stage, many features are immature or unimplemented.

Do not use in production environment, otherwise the consequences!

## 1.Introducing
This software is a library for the C/C++ language.
It contains many useful modules with a powerful variety of classes and functions (methods)

Including but not limited to:
- 1. Basic data types (e.g. String, Integer)
- 2. More powerful exception handling (including C language support)
- 3. Containers (collection, set, map, etc.)
- 4. Template (generic) classes and functions (C++ only)
- 5. Cross-platform underlying apis

## 2.Install/Uninstall
* There is no installer yet, you can download the source code, build the project yourself.

## 6.Technology

### About Generics (Templates) in This Project
A class whose class name is followed by a zero (hereinafter referred to as "the implementation class")
is usually a generic implementation class of a template class.

They separate the implementation of the template class
from the template by type erasure (pseudo-generic).

You should not extend (inherit) the implementation class from another class.
And you should not instantiate the implementation class directly.
The correct approach is to instantiate the template class.
Because the implementation class has no public methods.

Also, you shouldn't instantiate a template class with the implementation class as type,
because the template class usually privately extends (inherits) the implementation class.
